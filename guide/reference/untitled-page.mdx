title: "Field Normalization"
description: "Exact accepted values for industries, locations, company types, and other normalized fields used across Search APIs."
---


BlitzAPI Search endpoints (Company Search, People Search, Waterfall ICP) use **normalized values** for categorical filters. Passing an incorrect value (e.g., `"SaaS"` instead of `"Software Development"`) will silently return 0 results.

This reference lists every accepted value for each normalized field.


<Warning>
 **All enum values are case-sensitive and must match exactly.** Copy-paste from this page to avoid typos.
</Warning>


---


## Filter Patterns


Before diving into values, here are the two filter patterns used across all Search APIs.


### Keyword Filter (include / exclude)

Used for: `company.name`, `company.keywords`, and (upcoming) `person.title`, `person.headline`.

```json
{
  "include": ["term1", "term2"],
  "exclude": ["unwanted_term"]
}
```

Logic: results must match **at least one** `include` term AND must **not** match any `exclude` term.


### Enum Filter (include / exclude)

Used for: `company.industry`, `company.type`, and (upcoming) `person.seniority`.

```json
{
  "include": ["ExactValue1", "ExactValue2"],
  "exclude": ["ExactValue3"]
}
```

Logic: same as Keyword Filter, but values must be **exact matches** from the lists below.


### Range Filter (min / max)

Used for: `company.employee_count`, `company.founded_year`, and (upcoming) `person.connections_count`.

```json
{ "min": 100, "max": 5000 }
```

Set `max` to `0` (or omit) to leave the upper bound open.

## Sales Regions

| `NORAM`   | North America (US, CA, MX)                                |
| `LATAM`   | Latin America (BR, AR, CL, CO, etc.)                      |
| `EMEA`    | Europe, Middle East & Africa                               |

## Country Codes

Used in: `company.hq.country_code` and Waterfall ICP `location` field.

Country codes follow the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** standard (consistent with LinkedIn).

<Tip>
 For Waterfall ICP Search, use `"WORLD"` to search globally without geographic restriction. This special value is **not** available in Company Search — use an empty `hq` object instead.

## Upcoming: People Search Normalization


<Note>
 **Coming Soon** — The People Search API (`/v2/search/people`) will reuse the same normalization patterns documented above (country codes, sales regions, continents, job levels, job functions) plus additional person-specific filters like school/degree keyword search using the same `include` / `exclude` pattern.

 The filter patterns (`KeywordFilter`, `EnumFilter`, `RangeFilter`, `LocationFilter`) will remain identical.
</Note>

## Common Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
 <Accordion title="I get 0 results but my filters look correct">
   **Check exact values.** The most common cause is a non-normalized industry or country code. For example, `"Tech"` is not a valid industry — use `"Technology; Information and Internet"`. Similarly, `"USA"` is not valid — use `"US"`.
 </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="Can I use partial matches for industry?">
   **No.** Industry is an exact-match enum filter. You cannot pass `"Software"` to match `"Software Development"`. Use `keywords.include` for fuzzy matching on the company description instead.
 </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="How do I search globally without a location filter?">
   Simply omit the `hq` field entirely, or pass an empty object: `"hq": {}`. In **Company Search**, there is no `"WORLD"` keyword (that's only for Waterfall ICP).
 </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="What's the difference between employee_count and employee_range?">
   `employee_count` is a **numeric range** (`min`/`max`) on the actual LinkedIn headcount. `employee_range` uses LinkedIn's **predefined buckets** (`"51-200"`, `"201-500"`, etc.). Use `employee_range` for most use cases — it's more reliable since companies self-report their bucket.
