## ⚡ Waterfall: Standard vs. Real-Time


We offer two versions of the Waterfall ICP endpoint. Choosing the right one is key to managing your credits and latency.


| Feature         | Standard `/waterfall-icp-keyword`                    | Real-Time `/waterfall-icp-real-time`                                 |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Source** | Freshly Cached Data                          | Live Network Query                                                   |
| **Latency**     | **\< 1 second**                              | **3-5 seconds**                                                      |
| **Cost**        | 1 Credit / result                            | 3 Credits / result                                                   |
| **Use Case**    | High volume, large audiences, broad mapping. | Specific targets, niche roles, or when "Standard" yields no results. |


<Note>
 **Strategy**: We recommend attempting the **Standard** endpoint first. Only switch to **Real-Time** if the standard search returns `results_length: 0`.

## 📧 Email Logic: Matching vs. Guessing


A common misconception is that enrichment APIs "guess" emails (permutations like `first.last@domain.com`). **BlitzAPI does not do this.**


### How we work


1. **Identity Matching**: We match the LinkedIn profile against a massive dataset of known, verified identities.
2. **No Permutations**: We only return an email if we have a concrete record of it linked to that specific individual.
3. **Freshness Guarantee**:
  - We do not serve stale data.
  - Every email in our database is re-validated **at least once every 30 days**.
  - If an email bounces during our internal checks, it is immediately removed from the circulation.


This approach ensures a significantly lower bounce rate compared to "pattern-matching" tools.

## 🚦 Rate Limits & Latency


To ensure stability for all users:


- **Concurrency**: All plans include **5 concurrent requests per second**.
- **Burst**: Short bursts above this limit may be queued, but sustained overage will return `429 Too Many Requests`.
- **Timeouts**: Set your client timeout to at least **15 seconds** if you are using Real-Time endpoints or Email Validation, as live verification involves network handshakes with external mail servers.
