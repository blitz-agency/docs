This section covers technical standards and logic details to help you optimize your API usage.

## 🌍 Country Codes (LinkedIn)

The Waterfall Search API uses **LinkedIn country codes**, not ISO codes. Using the wrong code (e.g., `USA` instead of `US`) will return 0 results.

<Tip>
  Use `"WORLD"` to search globally without geographic restriction.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Common Country Codes List">
  | Country | Code |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | **United States** | `US` |
  | **United Kingdom** | `GB` |
  | **France** | `FR` |
  | **Canada** | `CA` |
  | **Germany** | `DE` |
  | **Australia** | `AU` |
  | **India** | `IN` |
  | **Brazil** | `BR` |
  | **Singapore** | `SG` |
  
  *For a full list of supported codes, refer to the [Microsoft LinkedIn Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/reference-tables/country-codes).*

## ⚡ Waterfall: Standard vs. Real-Time

We offer two versions of the Waterfall ICP endpoint. Choosing the right one is key to managing your credits and latency.

| Feature | Standard `/waterfall-icp` | Real-Time `/waterfall-icp-real-time` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Source** | Freshly Cached Data | Live Network Query |
| **Latency** | **< 1 second** | **3-5 seconds** |
| **Cost** | 1 Credit / result | 3 Credits / result |
| **Use Case** | High volume, large audiences, broad mapping. | Specific targets, niche roles, or when "Standard" yields no results. |

<Note>
  **Strategy**: We recommend attempting the **Standard** endpoint first. Only switch to **Real-Time** if the standard search returns `results_length: 0`.
</Note>

## 📧 Email Logic: Matching vs. Guessing

A common misconception is that enrichment APIs "guess" emails (permutations like `first.last@domain.com`). **BlitzAPI does not do this.**

### How we work
1.  **Identity Matching**: We match the LinkedIn profile against a massive dataset of known, verified identities.
2.  **No Permutations**: We only return an email if we have a concrete record of it linked to that specific individual.
3.  **Freshness Guarantee**:
    * We do not serve stale data.
    * Every email in our database is re-validated **at least once every 30 days**.
    * If an email bounces during our internal checks, it is immediately removed from the circulation.

This approach ensures a significantly lower bounce rate compared to "pattern-matching" tools.

## 🚦 Rate Limits & Latency

To ensure stability for all users:

* **Concurrency**: All plans include **5 concurrent requests per second**.
* **Burst**: Short bursts above this limit may be queued, but sustained overage will return `429 Too Many Requests`.
* **Timeouts**: Set your client timeout to at least **10 seconds** if you are using Real-Time endpoints or Email Validation, as live verification involves network handshakes with external mail servers.
