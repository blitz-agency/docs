## 🔗 The LinkedIn Matching Key

BlitzAPI operates its own proprietary dataset, centered on LinkedIn. All contact and company data is tied to LinkedIn profiles. The **Company LinkedIn URL** is the primary matching key across most APIs.

This is a deliberate choice: LinkedIn URLs provide reliable, unique identification that ensures data quality. Other identifiers like website domains are less reliable (multiple domains per company, domain changes, redirects, etc.).

<Warning>
  **Domains are not accepted as direct input** to People Search, Waterfall ICP, Employee Finder, or Company Enrichment. If your source data only contains domains, run the **Domain to LinkedIn URL** API first to convert them.
</Warning>

**Recommended workflow when starting from domains:**

```
Domain → Domain to LinkedIn URL → Company LinkedIn URL → People Search / Waterfall ICP / Enrichment
```

## 📧 Email Logic: Real Emails, Not Guesswork

Most email providers ask for first name, last name, and domain, then construct the email using patterns (e.g., `firstname.lastname@domain.com`). **BlitzAPI does not use this technology.**

Our emails come from real web sources and are matched to the correct LinkedIn profile. The input is a **Person LinkedIn URL**, not a name + domain combination.

### Verification

Every email in the dataset is verified **at least once per month** using catch-all email validation technology. If an email bounces during our internal checks, it is immediately removed from circulation.

### Coverage

The dataset contains approximately **65 million verified emails worldwide**. Coverage may be lower for certain segments — especially juniors, interns, or people with a small web footprint. If the email was never captured from a web source, it won't be in the dataset.

### Best Practice: Use BlitzAPI First in Your Waterfall

Since there is no additional cost per enrichment, always use BlitzAPI as the **first step** in a waterfall enrichment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: BlitzAPI">
    Enrich via BlitzAPI — real emails, top quality, no extra cost.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Fallback Provider">
    For contacts not found, use another provider with the pattern-based technology (first name + last name + domain).
  </Step>
</Steps>

This combination maximizes both coverage and quality.

## 📱 Phone Numbers: US Only

Phone number enrichment follows the same logic as email enrichment. Input is a **Person LinkedIn URL**.

Phone numbers are validated, and approximately 90–95% of results are mobile numbers.

<Warning>
  **Geographic limitation**: Phone numbers are only available for the **United States**. There is no coverage outside the US. Contacts and emails remain available worldwide.
</Warning>

## 🚦 Rate Limits & Latency

To ensure stability for all users:

| Parameter       | Value                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency** | 5 requests per second (standard)                                                                                                                             |
| **Burst**       | Short bursts may be queued; sustained overage returns `429 Too Many Requests`                                                                                |
| **Timeout**     | Set your client timeout to at least **15 seconds** for Email Validation endpoints (live verification involves network handshakes with external mail servers) |

## 💰 Pricing Model

BlitzAPI uses a **flat monthly fee** with no credit system. Once subscribed, all data is unlimited: contacts, emails, phone numbers, with no additional cost per request.

This means you can:

- **Iterate fast** without worrying about wasting credits
- **Make mistakes** (delete data, rerun requests) with zero additional cost
- **Test freely** — new targeting strategies, new ICP configurations, new workflows
- **Scale campaigns** as much as needed with no incremental data cost
