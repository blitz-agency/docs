## ⚡ Core Logic: Waterfall ICP

BlitzAPI’s most popular feature is the **Waterfall ICP Search**. It solves a common engineering challenge: mapping a target account to a specific decision-maker without manual filtering.

Instead of retrieving a raw list of employees, you define a **priority hierarchy**. The API executes a cascading search until it matches your criteria.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Define the Cascade">
    You configure a JSON rule: _"First, look for the CEO in the US. If not found, look for the VP of Sales. If not found, look for a Sales Director."_
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Intelligent Routing">
    The API queries live data layers in real-time, respecting your priority order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Structured Output">
    You receive the single most relevant decision-maker for that company, ready for enrichment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## ♾️ The Unlimited Model

For high-volume operations, we offer **Unlimited Plans** (Pro, Ultra, Mega). These plans remove per-request costs for our four core infrastructure endpoints.

This allows you to scale enrichment workflows without calculating marginal costs per lead.

## Technical Differentiators

Why do engineering teams choose BlitzAPI over static databases?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Live Signal" icon="tower-broadcast">
    We do not serve cached data older than 30 days. We query the network in real-time (1-3s latency) to ensure employment status is current.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strict Validation" icon="shield-check">
    We do not guess emails based on patterns (e.g., `first.last`). We only return data that passes a live SMTP handshake or identity match.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer Native" icon="terminal">
    Standard REST principles, predictable JSON responses, and native integrations with low-code orchestrators.
