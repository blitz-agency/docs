title: "Recipe: Account Breakthrough"
description: "Stop Spray & Pray. Penetrate strategic accounts with surgical precision."
---


**The Challenge**: You have a list of 500 "Dream Accounts" (ICP) in your CRM.


**The Old Way**: Your SDRs spend days manually searching LinkedIn, copying random emails, and hitting "Send" to whoever they find.


**The Blitz Way**: Automate the entire breakthrough process. Identify the buying committee, verify their data, and enroll them in sequences---instantly.


This playbook demonstrates how to build an **Account Breakthrough Engine** using BlitzAPI.

## 🛠️ The Stack


- **Orchestrator**: n8n or Make (to glue everything together).
- **Data Engine**: BlitzAPI (Waterfall ICP + Validation).
- **Source of Truth**: HubSpot / Salesforce (Input).
- **Execution**: Smartlead / Lemlist (Cold Email).

## 🗺️ The Workflow


We will move from a "List of Domains" to "Active Conversations" in 4 automated steps.


<Steps>
 <Step title="1. Input: The Target List">
   Your workflow pulls the target accounts from your CRM.


   - _Required Data_: Company Domain (e.g., `stripe.com`) or Company LinkedIn URL.
 </Step>
 <Step title="2. The 'Waterfall' Penetration">
   We don't just want _any_ contact. We want the **Economic Buyer** first, then the **Champion**.


   We send the company to BlitzAPI with a strict hierarchy:


   1. **Tier 1**: C-Level & VPs (The Decision Makers).
   2. **Tier 2**: Directors (The Champions).
   3. **Tier 3**: Managers (The Entry Points).
 </Step>
 <Step title="3. The Safety Gate (Validation)">
   Every profile found is passed through BlitzAPI's **Email Validation**.


   - **Valid**: Sync to CRM & Smartlead immediately.
   - **Catch-All**: Route to a manual review list (optional) or secondary sequence.
   - **Invalid**: Discarded automatically to protect domain reputation.
 </Step>
 <Step title="4. Contextual Sync">
   Push data back to the CRM with context tags:


   - `Tag: Tier 1 - Decision Maker`
   - `Tag: Tier 2 - Champion`


   This allows Smartlead/Lemlist to send **different scripts** to the VP (Strategic value) vs. the Manager (Operational pain).
 </Step>
</Steps>

## 🧠 The "Waterfall" Configuration


This is the brain of the operation. By setting `max_results: 5`, we ensure we penetrate the account with multiple touchpoints without spamming the entire directory.


**Endpoint**: `POST /api/search/waterfall-icp-keyword`


```json
{
 "company_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/target-account",
 "cascade": [
   {
     "include_title": ["Chief Revenue Officer", "CRO", "VP Sales", "Head of Growth"],
     "location": ["US", "GB"],
     "include_headline_search": false
   },
   {
     "include_title": ["Sales Director", "Director of Business Development"],
     "location": ["US", "GB"],
     "include_headline_search": true
   },
   {
     "include_title": ["Sales Manager", "Account Executive Team Lead"],
     "location": ["US", "GB"],
     "include_headline_search": false
   }
 ],
 "max_results": 5
}
```


<Note>
 **Pro Tip**: Notice the `max_results: 5`. BlitzAPI will fill these 5 slots starting from the top of your cascade. If it finds 5 C-Levels, it stops there. If it only finds 1 C-Level, it fills the remaining 4 slots with Directors. **You always get the best possible seniority mix.**
</Note>

## 🚀 Why the "Unlimited Model" Enables This


Running this strategy with traditional "Per Credit" providers is prohibitively expensive. Enriching 5 contacts per company across 1,000 accounts = **5,000 credits**.


With BlitzAPI's **Unlimited Plan**:


- **Cost**: Included in your flat monthly fee.
- **Risk**: Zero. You can run this on 100,000 accounts if you want.
- **Refresh**: You can re-run this playbook every quarter to catch new hires (Job Changes) without worrying about the bill.
