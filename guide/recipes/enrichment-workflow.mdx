description: 'Execute a complete Search → Enrich → Validate workflow using cURL.'

This guide demonstrates the full business logic of BlitzAPI. We will turn a target company (e.g., "Stripe") into a qualified, verified lead ready for your CRM.

## The Workflow

We will perform three distinct business actions:
1.  **Target**: Identify the "Head of Sales" at a specific company.
2.  **Enrich**: Extract their verified professional email.
3.  **Validate**: Confirm the email is safe to send.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Target the Decision Maker">
    **Goal**: Find the most relevant profile URL without browsing LinkedIn manually.
    
    We use the **Waterfall Search** to define our priority: "Give me the VP of Sales. If not found, give me the Sales Director."

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST "[https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/search/waterfall-icp](https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/search/waterfall-icp)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
         -d '{
               "company_linkedin_url": "[https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe)",
               "cascade": [
                 {
                   "include_title": ["VP Sales", "Head of Sales"],
                   "location": ["US", "GB"]
                 },
                 {
                   "include_title": ["Sales Director"],
                   "location": ["US", "GB"]
                 }
               ]
             }'
    ```

    **Key Output to capture:**
    Locate the `person_linkedin_url` in the response. You will need it for the next step.

    ```json
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "full_name": "John Doe",
          "job_title": "VP of Sales",
          "person_linkedin_url": "[https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe-stripe-vp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe-stripe-vp)",
          "icp": 1
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Enrich Profile">
    **Goal**: Convert the LinkedIn public URL into private contact data.
    
    Paste the URL obtained in Step 1 into the `linkedin_profile_url` field.

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST "[https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/enrichment/email](https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/enrichment/email)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
         -d '{
               "linkedin_profile_url": "[https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe-stripe-vp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe-stripe-vp)"
             }'
    ```

    **Key Output to capture:**
    If `found: true`, capture the `email`.

    ```json
    {
      "found": true,
      "email": "john.doe@stripe.com"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Validate Deliverability (Optional)">
    **Goal**: Ensure high deliverability rates before adding to your Outreach tool.
    
    *Note: BlitzAPI enrichment already verifies emails, but this endpoint gives you deeper SMTP details (like catch-all status).*

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST "[https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/email/validate](https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/email/validate)" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
         -d '{
               "email": "john.doe@stripe.com"
             }'
    ```

    **Final Decision:**
    * `status: "valid"` → **Safe to send.**
    * `status: "catch-all"` → **Risky.** (Acceptable if you have high domain reputation).
    * `status: "invalid"` → **Do not send.**
  </Step>
