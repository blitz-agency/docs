Data decay is inevitable, but manual cleaning is obsolete. With BlitzAPI's **Unlimited Model**, RevOps teams can shift from "Annual Cleaning" to **"Continuous Hygiene"**.


Instead of buying static lists, you can build **Dynamic Playbooks** that trigger exactly when you need them.

## Playbook 1: The "Dynamic Account" Enrichment


_(The "Surgical Strike" Approach)_


**The Scenario**: A Sales Rep is working a high-priority Account in Salesforce/HubSpot. The account has potential, but the Rep lacks the _right_ contacts (e.g., the VP of Sales is missing).


**The Solution**: Instead of asking the Rep to go to LinkedIn and manually copy-paste data, you give them an **"Enrich Now" button** in the CRM.


<Steps>
 <Step title="1. Trigger (The Button)">
   The Rep clicks a button in the CRM (via a Webhook/Flow).
 </Step>
 <Step title="2. The Waterfall Search">
   The automation sends the Company Domain to BlitzAPI's **Waterfall ICP** endpoint.


   - _Query_: "Find the VP Sales or CRO in the US for this company."
 </Step>
 <Step title="3. Automatic Sync">
   BlitzAPI returns the **Verified Email** and **Phone**. The automation creates the Contact in the CRM and assigns it to the Rep instantly.
 </Step>
</Steps>

## Playbook 2: The "Pre-Send" Safety Net


_(The Anti-Bounce Shield)_


**The Scenario**: You are about to enroll 5,000 leads into a cold email sequence. Some data is old; some emails might be "Catch-All".


**The Solution**: An automated gatekeeper that validates every email _before_ it enters the sequence.


<Steps>
 <Step title="1. Batch Export">
   Your automation tool (n8n/Make) pulls the list of emails.
 </Step>
 <Step title="2. Strict Validation">
   Pass every email through `/api/email/validate`.


   - BlitzAPI checks: Syntax, DNS, and performs a live SMTP handshake.
 </Step>
 <Step title="3. Routing">
   - **Valid**: Enrolled in Sequence A (Aggressive).
   - **Catch-All**: Enrolled in Sequence B (Manual/LinkedIn).
   - **Invalid**: Marked as "Do Not Contact" in CRM.
 </Step>
</Steps>
