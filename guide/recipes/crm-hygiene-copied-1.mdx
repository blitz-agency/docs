Data decay is inevitable, but manual cleaning is obsolete.
With BlitzAPI's **Unlimited Model**, RevOps teams can shift from "Annual Cleaning" to **"Continuous Hygiene"**.

Instead of buying static lists, you can build **Dynamic Playbooks** that trigger exactly when you need them.

## Playbook 1: The "Dynamic Account" Enrichment
*(The "Surgical Strike" Approach)*

**The Scenario**: A Sales Rep is working a high-priority Account in Salesforce/HubSpot. The account has potential, but the Rep lacks the *right* contacts (e.g., the VP of Sales is missing).

**The Solution**: Instead of asking the Rep to go to LinkedIn and manually copy-paste data, you give them an **"Enrich Now" button** in the CRM.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Trigger (The Button)">
    The Rep clicks a button in the CRM (via a Webhook/Flow).
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. The Waterfall Search">
    The automation sends the Company Domain to BlitzAPI's **Waterfall ICP** endpoint.
    * *Query*: "Find the VP Sales or CRO in the US for this company."
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Automatic Sync">
    BlitzAPI returns the **Verified Email** and **Phone**. The automation creates the Contact in the CRM and assigns it to the Rep instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why this changes the game
You stop enriching *every* company (wasteful). You enrich **only accounts with active intent**, ensuring 100% data freshness for the leads that actually matter.

## Playbook 2: The "Pre-Send" Safety Net
*(The Anti-Bounce Shield)*

**The Scenario**: You are about to enroll 5,000 leads into a cold email sequence. Some data is old; some emails might be "Catch-All".

**The Solution**: An automated gatekeeper that validates every email *before* it enters the sequence.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Batch Export">
    Your automation tool (n8n/Make) pulls the list of emails.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Strict Validation">
    Pass every email through `/api/email/validate`.
    * BlitzAPI checks: Syntax, DNS, and performs a live SMTP handshake.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Routing">
    * **Valid**: Enrolled in Sequence A (Aggressive).
    * **Catch-All**: Enrolled in Sequence B (Manual/LinkedIn).
    * **Invalid**: Marked as "Do Not Contact" in CRM.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Use `/email/validate` to filter out risks before they hurt your domain reputation.
