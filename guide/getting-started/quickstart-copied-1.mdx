Welcome to BlitzAPI! In this guide, we will perform a simple but powerful task: **finding a verified professional email** from a LinkedIn profile URL.

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**: You need an API Key. You can grab one from your [BlitzAPI Dashboard](https://app.blitzapi.io).
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your client">
    BlitzAPI is a standard REST API, so you can use it with any language.

    We recommend using **cURL** to test quickly in your terminal, or **Node.js/Python** for building integration scripts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare the request">
    We will use the `/api/enrichment/email` endpoint.

    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash cURL
    curl -X POST "[https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/enrichment/email \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
         -d '{
               "linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates"
             }'
    ```

    
    ```javascript Node.js
    const axios = require('axios');
    
    async function enrichProfile() {
      const response = await axios.post(
        '[https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/enrichment/email](https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/enrichment/email)',
        {
          linkedin_profile_url: '[https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates)'
        },
        {
          headers: { 'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY' }
        }
      );
    
      console.log(response.data);
    }
    
    enrichProfile();
    ```

    
    ```python Python
    import requests
    
    url = "[https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/enrichment/email](https://api.blitz-agency.com/api/enrichment/email)"
    payload = {
        "linkedin_profile_url": "[https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates)"
    }
    headers = {
        "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    print(response.json())
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the response">
    You should receive a JSON object containing the verified email and its status.

    ```json
    {
      "found": true,
      "email": "bill.gates@gatesfoundation.org"
    }
    ```

    <Note>
      **Cost**: This successful request costs **1 credit**. If the email is not found (`found: false`), the cost is **0 credits**.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What just happened?

1. **Authentication**: You passed your key via the `x-api-key` header.
2. **Live Signal**: BlitzAPI queried the network in real-time.
3. **Verification**: We validated the email deliverability before returning it.
