Welcome to BlitzAPI! In this guide, we will perform a simple but powerful task: **finding a verified professional email** from a LinkedIn profile URL.


<Info>
 **Prerequisites**: You need an API Key. You can grab one from your [BlitzAPI Dashboard](https://app.blitz-api.ai).
</Info>


<Steps>
 <Step title="Choose your client">
   BlitzAPI is a standard REST API, so you can use it with any language.


   We recommend using **cURL** to test quickly in your terminal, or **Node.js/Python** for building integration scripts.
 </Step>
 <Step title="Prepare the request">
   We will use the `/api/enrichment/email` endpoint.


   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key.


   <CodeGroup>


   ```bash cURL
   curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.blitz-api.ai/v2/enrichment/email \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-api-key: antoine-blitz_TPX9fhCmYG4xL37TNkpMpoit' \
     --data '
   {
     "person_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-blitz-5581b7373"
   }
   ```


  
   ```python Python
   import requests
  
   url = "https://api.blitz-api.ai/v2/enrichment/email"
  
   payload = { "person_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-blitz-5581b7373" }
   headers = {
       "x-api-key": "antoine-blitz_TPX9fhCmYG4xL37TNkpMpoit",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
   }
  
   response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
  
   print(response.text)
   ```


   </CodeGroup>
 </Step>
 <Step title="Check the response">
   You should receive a JSON object containing the verified email and its status.


   ```json
   {
     "found": true,
     "email": "antoine@blitz-agency.com",
     "all_emails": [
       {
         "email": "antoine@blitz-agency.com",
         "job_order_in_profile": 1,
         "company_linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/blitz-api",
         "email_domain": "blitz-agency.com"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```


   <Note>
     **Cost**: This successful request costs **1 credit**. If the email is not found (`found: false`), the cost is **0 credits**.
   </Note>
 </Step>
</Steps>


## What just happened?


1. **Authentication**: You passed your key via the `x-api-key` header.
3. **Verification**: We validated the email deliverability before returning it.
