title: 'The Unlimited Model'
description: 'Scale your growth operations without worrying about credit consumption.'
---

Most B2B data providers charge per credit. This punishes you for scaling. 
**BlitzAPI is different.** We believe high-volume teams should have predictable costs.

## Why Unlimited?

Modern GTM teams don't operate at "1,000 credits per month." They operate at millions of calls.

<Check>
  **No Seat Licenses**: Share the API key across your whole engineering and sales team.
</Check>
<Check>
  **Predictable Billing**: No surprise overage fees at the end of the month.
</Check>
<Check>
  **High Throughput**: All plans include **5 requests per second** (RPS) by default.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does 'Unlimited' include real-time validation?">
    Yes. When we provide an email in the Ultra or Mega plans, it is validated in real-time. We don't just give you a database string; we ping the server to ensure it exists.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I upgrade later?">
    Absolutely. You can switch from Pro to Ultra instantly from your dashboard if your needs change (e.g., you decide to start emailing your leads).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I hit the rate limit?">
    If you exceed 5 requests per second, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. We recommend implementing a simple retry logic or "backoff" strategy in your code.
