description: "Understand the difference between Pay-as-you-go and Unlimited Infrastructure."
---

BlitzAPI offers two distinct billing architectures to match your stage of growth. Whether you are running a small experimental script or a massive production pipeline, we have a model that fits.

---

## 1. The Pay-as-you-go Model (Classic)

Ideal for prototyping, low-volume needs, or occasional usage. You purchase credits, and you spend them only on successful requests.

| Action               | Cost              |
| :------------------- | :---------------- |
| **Enrich Email**     | 1 credit          |
| **Enrich Phone**     | 3 credits         |
| **Waterfall Search** | 1 credit / result |
| **Validation**       | 0.5 credits       |

<Check>
  **Zero Waste**: If we don't find the data (e.g., email not found), you are not charged.
</Check>

---

## 2. The Unlimited Model (Infrastructure)

This is our vision for the future of B2B data. We believe that **data should be a fixed infrastructure cost**, just like your servers or database hosting. You shouldn't be punished for scaling your operations.

Our Unlimited Plans transform variable costs into a predictable flat fee, enabling you to run **millions of operations** without looking at your balance.

## Technical FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does 'Unlimited' really mean real-time data?">
    **Yes.** We do not serve "stale" database dumps to save costs. Even on Unlimited plans, every email request triggers a real-time SMTP handshake to verify validity, and every search queries the live network.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I hit the 5 RPS limit?">
    You will receive a standard `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP error.

    **Solution**: We recommend implementing a "leaky bucket" algorithm or a simple retry with exponential backoff in your code. This ensures your script pauses briefly rather than crashing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I switch between Pay-as-you-go and Unlimited?">
    Absolutely. You can start with \$50 of credits to test the API quality. Once your integration is stable and you're ready to scale, you can upgrade to the **Ultra** plan instantly from the dashboard.
